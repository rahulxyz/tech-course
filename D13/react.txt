JSX
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML.
It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript

Webpack is a popular module bundling system built on top of Node. js. 
It can handle not only combination and minification of JavaScript and CSS files, 
but also other assets such as image files (spriting) through the use of plugins.

Babel is a JavaScript compiler that includes the ability to compile JSX into 
regular JavaScript

Component lifecycle
1. componentDidMount() // single time called on initialization of component
2. componentDidUpdate() //called everytime when props is updated
3.componentWillUnmount() //called just before component is destroyed
 still remainging

state = for handling data locally in Component
props = for passing data from parent to child
